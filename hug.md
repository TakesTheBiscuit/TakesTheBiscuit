# Human User Guide
This is a template to help you create your own human user guide. The goal of a human user guide is to make working together and collaboration with colleagues easier, faster. The focus for this user guide is on the workplace. As such, many of the questions are geared towards information that would be pertinent to your colleagues.

## About me

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
* When I'm motivated or driven, I may struggle with work life balance - committing myself wholly to a subject matter for months at a time without surfacing for air
* During times that I am firing on all 12 cylinders you'll need to keep up or level-set expectations to avoid frustrating me; I'm a work in progress.

### When are you available?
* I live in the UK, Mornings are not my favourite at the moment - I find that mid morning and early evening I am most creative
* I've been known to work late .. and early.. and generally anywhere in between. Though I do turn off slack outside office hours for maximum concentration.

### What drives you nuts?
* Cyclical conversation or meandering to a point
* Lack of responses to fair or well formed questions. Lack of expectation setting.
* Time tracking

### What are your quirks?
* I don't buy into hierarchies fully, despite the fact we all have to operate in and around them. Challenge the status quo.
* Once promoted myself by changing my Job Title on linked-in and then retro-negotiated the official title change with my then boss. That was interesting.
* In terms of making decisions - I like to get 'just enough data' to make the decision, then take it and commit to trying something; I value iteration over long term stability for most things - especially technology wise!

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
* Let me clear: I am an empathetic leader - I understand everyone has a life behind the keyboard, that said, when there is work to be done or a challenge on our handS I want us to acknowledge each other, be empathetic and crack on - at times this may come across as being 'quite direct' and I've certainly had this feedback before; look: I am just wired to want answers fast and at times I can struggle with small talk (even if my colleagues tell you otherwise!)
* Explicitly: I don't believe in silo's of communication; I value transparency and everything that comes with it - own it; this can be a point of friction for some; again, I'm a work in progress.

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
* *Tell us what your ideal colleague would look like. These are the people you normally seek out at work.*
* My ideal colleagues buy into the vision, understand how they can add value and move fast to add that value
* In a perfect world *things would just happen* - but we know that not to be true, and, so whilst we're in an imperfect world I know and appreciate that everyone is different - we all have a different appetite for work - so just please: communicate. Not going to be able to take something on?: communicate, not going to deliver to the expectation you set? communicate.. feeling off at the moment? communicate. - See also: 'What drives you nuts?'.

### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?
* Trying to solve world hunger on a stand up ;)

### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
* Commit to an action, work on it, and come back inside the expectation they set..
* Automate a thing, just pick something and automate it - I don't care if it's the timesheet tracking we do, or the deployment of widget X to environment Y - just go for it - and let me know how you got on, what you learned and how it felt.

## About my interactions

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
* We look at examples and real world situations that come up to guide where to go next
* Evaluating a learning path or roadmap for the individual and seeing which areas need work - guiding others towards areas that could use some work

### What’s the best way to communicate with you?
* The prompt here was 'Do you hate email': In a word: yes.
* I prefer instant communication like slack, if you have to: webex!
* When something is going to be larger than a YES/NO or RED/GREEN please let's just huddle it out for 10 mins to find a conclusion

### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
* Show me how I can improve, bring me some feedback with a case study. Use data.

### How do you like to give feedback?
* When we are talking about performance impact feedback: We'll do that face to face - either online or in the office ; we'll use examples of why we can't be here anymore and what needs to change.
* In cases of positive reinforcement feedback you'll get those 'thank yous' and day to day interactions almost immediately. I will always make space for you in a 1:1 setting minimum twice a month for us to deep dive into the weeds of it all.

### How do you like to get feedback?
* Honestly I am not picky about this - I would just welcome *more* feedback ; I don't know if it's my current setting but it sometimes can feel like an echo chamber!
