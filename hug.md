# Human User Guide Template
This is a template to help you create your own human user guide. The goal of a human user guide is to make working together and collaboration with colleagues easier, faster. The focus for this user guide is on the workplace. As such, many of the questions are geared towards information that would be pertinent to your colleagues.

## About me

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
* When I'm motivated or driven, I may struggle with work life balance - committing myself wholly to a subject matter for months at a time without surfacing for air
* During times that I am firing on all 12 cylinders you'll need to keep up or level-set expectations to avoid frustrating me; I'm a work in progress.

### When are you available?
* I live in the UK, Mornings are not my favourite at the moment - I find that mid morning and early evening I am most creative
* I've been known to work late .. and early.. and generally anywhere in between. Though I do turn off slack outside office hours for maximum concentration.

### What drives you nuts?
* Cyclical conversation or meandering to a point
* Lack of responses to fair or well formed questions
* Time tracking

### What are your quirks?
* I don't buy into hierarchies fully, despite the fact we all have to operate in and around them. Challenge the status quo.
* Once promoted myself by changing my Job Title on linked-in and then retro-negotiated the official title change with my then boss. That was interesting.
* In terms of making decisions - I like to get 'just enough data' to make the decision, then take it and commit to trying something; I value iteration over long term stability for most things - especially technology wise!

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
* Let me clear: I am an empathetic leader - I understand everyone has a life behind the keyboard, that said, when there is work to be done or a challenge on our handS I want us to acknowledge each other, be empathetic and crack on - at times this may come across as being 'quite direct' and I've certainly had this feedback before; look: I am just wired to want answers fast and at times I can struggle with small talk (even if my colleagues tell you otherwise!)
* Explicitly: I don't believe in silo's of communication; I value transparency and everything that comes with it - own it; this can be a point of friction for some; again, I'm a work in progress.

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
* *Tell us what your ideal colleague would look like. These are the people you normally seek out at work.*
* My ideal colleagues buy into the vision, understand how they can add value and move fast to add that value
* In a perfect world we'd have ...

### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?
* *Think of the people you avoid at work. What are their characteristics?*

### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
* *Think of the time when a colleague puts a smile on your face. What did they just do?*

## About my interactions

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
* *Tell us how you like to help others.*

### What’s the best way to communicate with you?
* *If you hate emails, tell us. If you prefer a quick zoom over a 15 min write up, tell us.*

### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
* *Tell us how we can change your mind, once it’s made up.*

### How do you like to give feedback?
* *Tell us the modes, means, timing, approach, and level of detail you like to employ when giving feedback, and why that's so.*

### How do you like to get feedback?
* *Tell us the modes, means, timing, approach, and level of detail you like to see others employ when giving you feedback, and why that's so.*
